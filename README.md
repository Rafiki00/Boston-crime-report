# Boston Crime Report

A comprehensive data engineering project that analyzes Boston crime data for trends, correlations, and insights. This project includes an end-to-end data pipeline using Airflow, a containerized environment with Docker, and a PostgreSQL database to store and process crime data.

## Background & Motivation
Explain why this project was created and what problems or questions it addresses.

> Example:  
> This project aims to understand crime patterns in Boston over multiple years. By analyzing publicly available data, we hope to highlight areas with high crime rates, trends over time, and insights that may inform law enforcement or policy decisions.

## Data Source
Provide details about where the data comes from and any relevant metadata.

- **Source**: (e.g., Boston Open Data Portal)  
- **Time Range**: 2016–2021  
- **Data Format**: CSV files, including columns for date/time, latitude/longitude, offense code, and more.

Mention any preprocessing steps (removing duplicates, cleaning missing values, etc.).

- **data/**: Raw datasets and cleaned/processed datasets.  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and/or reporting.  
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data transformation or additional processing steps.  
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the Docker containers (Airflow, PostgreSQL, etc.).

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- (Optional) Python + pip if you want to run any code locally outside the containers.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Boston-crime-report.git  
    cd Boston-crime-report

2. **Spin up the Docker environment**:

    docker-compose up --build

   This starts containers for Airflow (webserver, scheduler) and PostgreSQL.

3. **Check Airflow**:  
   - By default, the Airflow webserver may be available at http://localhost:8080 (depending on `docker-compose.yml` settings).  
   - The default Airflow username/password may also be set in your environment (look in your `.env` or the compose file).

4. **(Optional) Additional Local Steps**:  
   - If you want to run a Jupyter notebook locally (not in Docker), create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

        python -m venv venv  
        source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux  
        pip install -r requirements.txt

   - Then you can run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` to explore the notebooks.

## Data Pipeline / Workflow
Detail the workflow steps you implemented. For example:

1. **Extract**: Download or pull the Boston crime dataset from an open data portal.  
2. **Load**: Store the raw data in a staging table inside PostgreSQL.  
3. **Transform**: Use Airflow tasks or Python scripts to clean and format the data.  
4. **Analyze**: Notebook-based or script-based exploratory analysis and visualization.  
5. **Report**: Generate dashboards, plots, or summaries of findings.

If you have Airflow DAG files, mention how to enable or manually trigger them:

    airflow dags list  
    airflow dags trigger boston_crime_dag

---

## Analysis & Findings
Highlight interesting insights or visualizations:

- **Trend Analysis**: Crime rates by year, season, or day of week.  
- **Geographic Hotspots**: Mapping or clustering to identify areas with higher incidents.  
- **Correlations**: Any significant relationships between crime types and external factors (time of day, weather, demographics, etc.).

If you have images or charts, include them like so:

    ![Crime Hotspot Map](images/crime_hotspots.png)

> Example Key Takeaway:  
> Downtown Boston shows a higher density of reported crimes on weekends, largely involving theft and assault. Seasonal trends suggest an increase in burglaries during winter months.

---

## How to Use / Run the Project
1. **Running the Pipeline**: Once the Docker containers are up, Airflow may auto-schedule the main DAG. Or you can manually trigger it:

       airflow dags trigger boston_crime_dag

2. **Generating Reports**: If you have a notebook (e.g., `analysis.ipynb`), open it in Jupyter or another environment, run all cells, and review any charts or summary outputs.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Data Enrichment**: Merge with demographic or weather data to see more detailed correlations.  
- **Machine Learning**: Build predictive models for crime occurrence or severity.  
- **Dashboard**: Create an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Dash) to explore results in real time.  
- **Automated Data Updates**: Extend the pipeline to pull new data periodically and update analyses.
